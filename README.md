## A \- File Scrambler \(Archive protection\)


</div>

### Description

This program is a complete high-security file scrambler/encryptor. It's an alternative to a password-protected WinRAR file, with some differences. First of all, this is not a compressor, but primarily a file scrambler (encryptor) using very high security.

The program can create an archive file up to a total of 100 GB, but it's too slow to accomplish that (due to the heavy byte scrambler algorithm) (~100-250 KB/s), with a total of maximum 2 billion directories and 2 billion files, no matter how deep the dir-tree is. The program also splits file to 100 MB archive files, so they can be stored separatedly for extra protection of your data.

The algorithm uses a simple looking byte scrambler/encryption, but has uncrackable protection. No (gov-)authority will be able to crack the files unless they have the key. Current encryption standards use 256-bit keys(which are uncrackable atm), FileScrambler uses a totally different byte approach, and accepts keys up to 8192 bits (value is increasable because it's stored as a constant). See it for yourself!

Also, this code contains several usefull code snippets for intermediate programmers, for example 'Using a linked list to store directory-trees with unlimited depth' and some other small details..

I hereby ask experienced programmers to check this program, search for bugs, give feedback and rate. I highly appreciate any feedback on this program. Thanks in advance!
